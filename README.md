# RAG Model with LangChain ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the **RAG Model with LangChain** repository! This project features a Streamlit app that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot. Users can upload text files, and the app processes them using LangChain and Groq to answer questions based on the content of the uploaded documents.

## Introduction

The RAG Model with LangChain project combines the power of natural language processing and document retrieval. It allows users to engage with their documents in an interactive way. By uploading text files, users can ask questions, and the chatbot will generate answers based on the content.

This repository aims to make it easier for developers and researchers to implement similar systems in their own projects. Whether you are building a chatbot for customer support or a personal assistant, this framework provides a solid foundation.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- **File Upload**: Users can upload various text files for processing.
- **Dynamic Responses**: The chatbot generates answers based on the uploaded content.
- **Integration with LangChain and Groq**: Leverages advanced NLP capabilities for improved understanding and response generation.
- **Vector Database**: Efficiently manages and retrieves relevant information.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web application.
- **LangChain**: For language model integration.
- **Groq**: For querying and processing documents.
- **ChromaDB**: For managing vector databases.
- **Hugging Face**: For accessing pre-trained models.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monirsayah/RAG-Model-with-LangChain.git
   cd RAG-Model-with-LangChain
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the App**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

Using the RAG chatbot is straightforward:

1. **Upload Your Document**: Click the "Upload" button and select a text file from your device.
2. **Ask Questions**: Type your questions into the input box and hit "Enter."
3. **Receive Answers**: The chatbot will generate responses based on the content of your uploaded document.

### Example Questions

- "What is the main topic of the document?"
- "Can you summarize the second paragraph?"
- "What are the key points mentioned?"

## How It Works

The RAG Model operates by first retrieving relevant information from the uploaded documents. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process:

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload text files through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Processing with LangChain**: The app uses LangChain to process the content and prepare it for querying.
3. **Query Execution**: When a user asks a question, the app retrieves relevant sections from the document.
4. **Response Generation**: The chatbot generates an answer using the retrieved information.

This architecture allows for efficient document handling and responsive interaction.
